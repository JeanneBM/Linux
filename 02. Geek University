uname -a - to find out the kernel version of your Linux installation

All files and directories appear under the root directory (represented with a single slash – /).

Hardware devices are represented by a special file stored in the /dev directory 
(for example, /dev/sda usually represents the first hard disk on the system).

All files and directories appear under the root directory (/). 

/boot – contains files related to the initial booting of the computer.
/bin – contains certain critical executable files, such as ls, cp, and mount.
/dev – contains device files like hard disks or CD-ROMs.
/sbin – similar to /bin, but it contains programs that are normally run only by the system administrator.
/etc – contains configuration files.
/home – user’s home directory.
/lib – contains program libraries.
/media – mount point for removable media.
/usr – contains the majority of user utilities and applications.
/var – variable files such as logs.
/tmp – contains temporary files.

 a shell is a CLI (Command-Line Interface) between a users and the kernel. 
 
 Some common shells found in Linux distributions are:+

    bash – bash stands for Bourne Again Shell. The most common default shell.
    C shell – the shell with the interface similar to the C language.
    Korn – popular among UNIX System V users.
    
    @ sign is the hostname of the computer (ubuntu in this case). 
    
ls command
The ls command lists the directory content. If no directory is specified, the command will display the content of the working directory.

pwd command
The pwd command is used to print the path of the current directory.

mkdir command
To create a new directoy, the mkdir command is used. You must specify the name of the directory. If no path is specified, 
the directory is created inside the working directory.

The syntax of the info command simple, just type info followed by the command. 
Note that not all commands have information available in the info database.



man -k = apropos



echo command
The echo command is used to to output text to the screen. You simply type echo and then the text you would like to display.

whoami command
The whoami command displays the username of the current user.

cd command
To change the current working directory we use the cd command. You must specify the path of the directory you would like to access.

history
You can also press Ctrl+r to search your command history. For example, to search the history for commands that include dd, 
we would press Ctrl+r and then type dd
To find the next command in history that includes dd, we can press Ctrl+r again.
Typing history -c clears the history. Use this option if you have typed commands that include passwords. 
  
A directory is a location for storing files on your computer.

If you use the rm command, you need to include the -r option, which means that the command will remove the directory 
and its content recursively.

The most common way to create a file in Linux is by using the touch command. 
>> Although the primary purpose of this command is to update the timestamp of a file, it is often instead used to create one.

Environment variables are placeholders for data that can change.
For example, each user typically has its own home directory, 
so the content of the HOME environment variable is different for each user on the system. 
A program that needs to know the user’s home directory can refer to the HOME variable to obtain this information.

To see the environment variables on your system, type env.

To set an environment variable manually, use the equal-sign assignment operator (=). If you want your variable 
to be available to programs you launch from your shell, use the export command.
In the example above we have assigned the value example to the variable VAR1. 
For brevity, you can comibne these two commands in one: export VAR1=example.
To refer to an environment variable, use the dollar sign ($) in front of the variable name.
In the example above we have used the echo command to display the content of the variable VAR1.+

Setting an environment variable as described above sets it permanently only for the current shell.
For example, if you open another terminal window, the variable VAR1 will not be set.
To make environment variables permanent you need to set them in a global or local bash startup script.

Environment variables can be deleted using the unset command, which takes the name of an environment variable (without the leading $ symbol) 
as a parameter. In our case, unset VAR1 deletes the VAR1 environment variable. 

Here is a list of common environment variables in Linux:
    USER – your current username.
    SHELL – the path to the current command shell (for example, /bin/bash).
    PWD – the current working directory.
    HOSTNAME – the hostname of the computer.
    HOME – your home directory.
    MAIL – the location of the user’s mail spool. Usually /var/spool/mail/USER.
    LANG – your current language.
    TZ – your time zone.
    PS1 – the default prompt in bash.
    TERM – the current terminal type (for example, xterm).
    DISPLAY – the display used by X. This variable is usually set to :0.0, which means the first display on the current computer.
    HISTFILESIZE – the maximum number of lines contained in the history file.
    EDITOR – the user’s preferred text editor.
    MANPATH – the list of directories to search for manual pages.
    OSTYPE – the type of operating system.

if PATH is set to /bin:/usr/sbin and you type echo, Linux looks for an executable program called echo in /bin and then in /usr/sbin.

./script.sh (the relative path (./) indicates the working directory) or /home/bob/script.sh (the absolute path)

An inode is a data structure that stores various information about a file in Linux, such as the access mode 
(read, write, execute permissions), ownership, file type, file size, group, number of links, etc. 
Each inode is identified by an integer number. An inode is assigned to a file when it is created.
You can view a file’s inode number using the ls -il command.
The first number on the left represents the inode number of the file.
An inode doesn’t store the content of the file and filename. 
inode - iwęzeł

By default, the ln command creates hard links. To create soft links, you need to use the -s option with the ln command.

Hard links can only be created to files on the same partition.

Three types of wildcards are common in Linux:
? – matches a single character. For example, O??d matches anything that begins with O, ends with d and has two characters in between 
(like Oind, Okhd, Oerd, but not Oereed, Oad, Oerererd.)
* – matches any character or set of characters, including no character. For example, O*d matches anything that begins with O and ends with d 
(like Oind, Okhd, Oerd, Oereed, Oad, Oerererd, Od, Oarmeerrd). The number of characters in between O and d is not important.
Bracketed values – match characters enclosed in square brackets. For example, O[ac]d matches only Oad and Ocd. 
You can also specify a range of values: O[a-e]d matches Oad, Obd, Ocd, Odd and Oed.

ls -l O[ac]d - to list all files that begin with O and end with d and have a or c in between 

Linux shells use three standard streams:
standard input – usually the input from the keyboard. For example, commands that are executed by typing them.
standard output – displays the output from commands, usually to the terminal.
standard error – displays error output from commands. It is usually sent to the same output as standard output, but it can be redirected.

You can redirect the input to a program from a file. [przekierowanie] Redirections are done using symbols after the command.

mail - takes the content of a file as standard input
