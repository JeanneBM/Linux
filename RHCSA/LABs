Lesson 1: Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Instal RHEL:
1. a graphical user interface should be installed
2. 10 GiB Root partition
3. 1 GiB Swap partition
4. 4 GiB of disk space remains as unused
5. set the root password "password"
6. create a user "student" with the password "password"
7. configure the network interface to contact a DHCP server

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lesson 2: Using Essential Tools 
1. locate the man page that shows how to set a password
2. use the man page for useradd
3. as root create a user "Anna"
4. set the password for user Anna to "password"
5. use cd /etc to make /etc your current directory
6. use globbing and the ls command to show all files in /etc that have a number in their number
7. still from /etc, use the command ls -l and use a pipe to display the results page by page 
8. type cd without any arguments
9. use vim to create a file with the name users and make sure that it contains the names: alex, alexander, linda, belinda on separate lines

Solution:
1. man -k password -> man -k password | grep 1 
2. man useradd -> Shift+G -> SEE ALSO -> passwd(1) -> q -> man passwd
3. useradd anna
4. passwd anna -> 2x"password"
5. cd /etc
6. ls *[0-9]* -> ls -d *[0-9]* //without of the content of the directories
7. ls -l | less
8. cd -> you will get back to home /root directory
9. vim users -> alex, alexander, linda, belinda -> ESC -> :wq!
