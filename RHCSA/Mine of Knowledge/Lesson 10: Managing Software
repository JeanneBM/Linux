10.1 Understanding RPM Packages

* Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) is a package format to install software, as well as a database of installed packages on a system
* The Package contains an archive of files that is compressed with cpio, as well as metadata and a list of package dependencies
* RPM Packages may contain scripts as well
* To install packages, repositories are used
* Individual packages may be installed, but this should be avoided

10.2 Setting up Repository Access

Setting up a Local Repository:

We'll create a local repository so that we can install packages from the RHEL 8 installation disk ISO image:
* Create an ISO image: dd if=/dev/sr0 of=/rhel8.iso bs=1M
* Create a directory /repo: mkdir /repo
* Edit /etc/fstab and add the following line to the end 
	* /rhel8.iso 	/repo 	  iso9660     defaults 	0 0
* Use mount -a to mount the ISO

dd if=/dev/sr0 of=/rhel8.iso bs=1M 
mkdir /repo
vim /etc/fstab
systemctl daemon-reload
mount -a 
cd /repo
ls
cd BaseOS
ls
cd ..

Accessing the Local Repository-1:
* Create the file /etc/yum.repos.d/appstream.repo with following contents [appstream]
	name=appstream
	baseurl=file:///repo/AppStream
	gpgcheck=0

cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
vim appstream.repo
+"[appstream ]
name=appstream
baseurl=file:///repo/AppStream
gpgcheck=0"
vim base.repo
+"[BaseOS]
name=BaseOS
baseurl=file:///repo/BaseOS
gpgcheck=0"
yum repolist

10.3 Understanding Modules and Application Streams

Understanding Application Streams:
* RHEL 8 introduces application streams and modules
* Application streams are used to separate user space packages from core kernel operations
* Using application streams allows for working with different versions of packages 
* Base packages are provided through the BaseOS repository
* AppStream is provided as a separate repository

Understanding Modules:
* Application Streams are delivered in two formats:
	* traditional RPMs
	* New Modules

* Modules can contain streams to make multiple versions of applications avaliable
* Enabling a module stream gives access to RPM packages in that stream
* Modules can also have profiles. A profile is a list of packages that belong to a specific use-case
* The package list of a module can contain packages outside the module stream
* Use the yum module commands to manage modules (see lesson 10.5)
