Vim has two basic modes. One is an insert mode, in which you write text as if in normal text editor.

Another is normal mode which provides you efficient ways to navigate and manipulate text.

At any time, you can see which mode you are in on the status bar which is located at the top of the editor.

To change between modes, use Esc for normal mode and i for insert mode.

In contrast to regular text editor, you use keys h,j,k, and l instead of arrow keys to move the cursor.



To navigate the text in terms of words, you can use keys w,b, and e (also W,B,E in real Vim).
w moves to the start of next word; e moves to the end of the word; and b moves to beginning of the word.



Moving within the text is not limited to individual keys; you can combine movement keys with a number. For example, 3w is the same as pressing w three times.



You can insert text multiple times. For example, an underline of a header might consist of 30 -s.
