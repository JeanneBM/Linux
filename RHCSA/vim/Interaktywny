1. Two modes: insert and normal

Vim has two basic modes. One is an insert mode, in which you write text as if in normal text editor.
Another is normal mode which provides you efficient ways to navigate and manipulate text.
At any time, you can see which mode you are in on the status bar which is located at the top of the editor.
To change between modes, use Esc for normal mode and i for insert mode.

2. Basic movement: h,j,k, and l

In contrast to regular text editor, you use keys h,j,k, and l instead of arrow keys to move the cursor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Word movement: w,e,b

To navigate the text in terms of words, you can use keys w,b, and e (also W,B,E in real Vim).
w moves to the start of next word; e moves to the end of the word; and b moves to beginning of the word.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Number powered movement: e.g. 5w

Moving within the text is not limited to individual keys; you can combine movement keys with a number. 
For example, 3w is the same as pressing w three times.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Insert text rapeatedly: e,g, 3iYes

You can insert text multiple times. For example, an underline of a header might consist of 30 -s.
------------------------------

With 30i- Esc, there's no need to press - 30 times.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Find a character: f and F

To find and move to the next (or previous) occurrence of a character, use f and F, e.g. fo finds next o.
You can combine f with a number. For example, you can find 3rd occurrence of 'q' with 3fq, que?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Go to matching parentheses, %

In text that is structured with parentheses or brackets ( or { or [, use % to jump to the matching parenthesis or bracket.

% + Shift
